# Julia Function Bug: Missing Return Statement

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: forgetting to include a `return` statement in all branches of a conditional statement within a function.  The provided `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides the corrected version.

This simple example shows how the lack of a return statement can cause unexpected behavior, particularly for functions designed to return a value.
